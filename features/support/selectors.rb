module HtmlSelectorsHelpers
  # Maps a name to a selector. Used primarily by the
  #
  #   When /^(.+) within (.+)$/ do |step, scope|
  #
  # step definitions in web_steps.rb
  #
  def selector_for(locator)

    # Add more mappings here.
    # Here is an example that pulls values out of the Regexp:
    #
    #  when /^the (notice|error|info) flash$/
    #    ".flash.#{$1}"

    # You can also return an array to use a different selector
    # type, like:
    #
    #  when /the header/
    #    [:xpath, "//header"]

    # This allows you to provide a quoted selector as the scope
    # for "within" steps as was previously the default for the
    # web steps:
   
  end
